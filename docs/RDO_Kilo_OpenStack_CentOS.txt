The main QuickStart guide is available at https://www.rdoproject.org/install/quickstart/

In this quick start there is link to older repos where it says "Looking for an older version? See http://rdoproject.org/repos/ for the full listing"

I am putting basic steps to get the liberty going on CentOS. These are for CentOS. For RHEL it is better to get these repo's using subscription-manager

### Install CentOS 7.1 on All (Controller, compute, etc) 


### stop NetworkManager on both controller and compute node
service NetworkManager stop
chkconfig NetworkManager off

### enable simple network
chkconfig network on

Here you may need to fix the interface file for your management ethernet interface, for example

vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ens9
DEVICE=ens9
NAME=ens9
IPADDR= 172.31.185.30
NETMASK=255.255.252.0
GATEWAY=172.31.184.1
DNS1=173.36.131.10
DNS2=171.70.168.183

service network restart (or reboot to make sure interface comes up)

## install liberty rdo-release repo
yum install https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/openstack/openstack-liberty/rdo-release-liberty-1.noarch.rpm

### install openstack-packstack (from here to end all instructions are to be done only on controller node)
yum install openstack-packstack

###  generate & modify answer file

[root@localhost ~]# packstack --help
Usage: packstack [options] [--help]

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --gen-answer-file=GEN_ANSWER_FILE
                        Generate a template of an answer file.

packstack --gen-answer-file=our_answer_file.txt

### modify answer file
CONFIG_CINDER_INSTALL=n (set it to 'y' if you want Cinder)
CONFIG_NAGIOS_INSTALL=n
CONFIG_KEYSTONE_ADMIN_PW=cisco123
CONFIG_COMPUTE_HOSTS=172.31.185.31,172.31.185.32 (Put all IP's that you want compute to be installed)
ENABLE_EPEL=y

### install openstack
packstack --answer-file=minako_answer-file_standalone

Above command will ask for passwords to other nodes and install openstack on all of them, it should be ready if no errors.
